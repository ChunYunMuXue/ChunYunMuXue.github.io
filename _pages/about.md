# 👋 About me

**Hello! I’m Yinxinxiang (尹新祥) 👋 **

I’m currently a junior majoring in Software Engineering at Northwestern Polytechnical University (NPU).

🧠 Since childhood, I have been enthusiastic about algorithmic problem solving and have devoted significant time to competitive programming, including **OI and XCPC🎈**. These experiences trained me to think rigorously and systematically. 

The photo on the web was taken when I had the opportunity to speak at the 49th ICPC Nanjing Regional Contest.

🔬 In recent years, I have gradually begun exploring potential research directions. I was fortunate to study **Computer Vision** under the guidance of **[Prof.Shaodian](https://teacher.nwpu.edu.cn/shaodian.html)** and learned some knowledge of **Randomized Numerical Linear Algebra for Machine Learning** under **[Prof. Liao Zhenyu](https://zhenyu-liao.github.io/)**. Through these experiences, I started to reflect more carefully on the mathematical structures and theoretical foundations behind modern AI systems.

📚 **I am still exploring my long-term research interests.** While I remain open to different possibilities, **I am currently most interested in Learning Theory**, as I hope to better understand the mathematical foundations of artificial intelligence — especially the question of why modern models generalize so well.

🎓 I am currently preparing and working hard on my applications for future Master’s/Ph.D. programs. And wish some good luck.
